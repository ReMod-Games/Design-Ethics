# Design Ethics
Design rules for the games developed at ReMod. This repository contains markdown (`.md`) files 
with the design rules written in them with common examples and other necessary information.

## Navigation
`Main.md` contains general design rules for every game, however, each game also follow 
their own set of designs. The respective ones can be found under `src/<game_name>`.

## Contributions
You can contribute to improving the design rules by the following ways:
- Improving Grammer, Vocabulary, etc.
- Rewriting parts in more appealing to read fashions.
- Discussing and eventually adding onto the design phiosophy. 
- Making sure that all rules apply retroactively and do not interfere with one another unless explicitely stated to.
